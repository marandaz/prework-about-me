      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Howdy, friends! I'm a Sr. Product Manager from the midwest. I'm forever in beta, constantly growing and evolving.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Well it looks like I got a little ahead of myself. I've called Milwaukee, Wisconsin my home for the last 8 years. Early 2020, I relocted to Seattle (what a time to pick up and move across the country, eh?)</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'll kick your butt in a gif war, hands down. Otherwise, I do a lot of hiking with my dog, Nigel. He's the cuttest little beagle you'll ever set your eyes on. If I'm not out being one with nature, I'm cuddled up with my Siamese cat, Nahla, with a good book. Anyone in the PNW, I'd love to hear about your favorite places to visit!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm incredibly fortunate to already have my dream job. I work for a "try-before-you-buy" online retailor that aims to take the hassle out of shopping. The best thing about my job, you ask? The people! I'm surrounded by so many intelligent individuals that work to be the best in their area. It's hard to go to work every day and not want to do better, be better, and strive for excellence. Every day is a new adventure unlike the last.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Again, ahead of myself. See above. The PNW has been an experience for sure.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>One of the biggest challenges I face today is that I'm required to rely on someone else to execute my vision, or the one that I'm driving. I want to DO the things, all the things. In my current role, it'd be silly to not want to learn new tech skills for a better understanding of product development, project timelines, and to futher my career as someday, a top notch developer.</p>
